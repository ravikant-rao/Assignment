      "question": "Why did the web developer bring a ladder to work?",
      "answer": "Because they heard React.js helps them build *high*-performance apps! ðŸš€ Itâ€™s like having a magic wand that makes websites faster than your Wi-Fi connection on a good day."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Why did the Virtual DOM go broke?",
      "answer": "Because it only updates whatâ€™s necessaryâ€”no unnecessary spending here! ðŸ’¸ Think of it as the Marie Kondo of web development: if it doesnâ€™t spark joy (or change), it doesnâ€™t get touched!"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What do developers use to build apps like Lego sets?",
      "answer": "Components! ðŸ§© Just like Legos, you can snap together pieces of your app to build something awesome without starting from scratch every time. Need a header? Done. Footer? Easy-peasy. Reusability at its finest!"
    },

      "id": 4,
      "question": "Why did the state go to therapy?",
      "answer": "Because it had too many mood swings! ðŸ˜… One moment itâ€™s happy, the next itâ€™s sadâ€”and the whole app has to adjust. Managing state is like being a therapist for your code: always listening, always updating."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Why did JSX get kicked out of the HTML club?",
      "answer": "Because it was sneaking JavaScript into the party! ðŸŽ‰ JSX is like that friend who blends two languages seamlessly, making your code look clean and readableâ€”but also a little suspicious to purists."
